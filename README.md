# Grid Library

The Grid Library was developed at the
[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)](http://www.nga.mil/) in
collaboration with [BIT Systems](https://www.caci.com/bit-systems/). The
government has "unlimited rights" and is releasing this software to increase the
impact of government investments by providing developers with the opportunity to
take things in new directions.

Software source code previously released under an open source license and then
modified by NGA staff is considered a "joint work" (see 17 USC ยง 101); it is
partially copyrighted, partially public domain, and as a whole is protected by
the copyrights of the non-government authors and must be released according to
the terms of the original open source license.
